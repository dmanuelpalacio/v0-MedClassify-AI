"Multi-Center Analysis of Treatment Outcomes in Acute Myeloid Leukemia","This large-scale retrospective analysis examines treatment outcomes in 2,500 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients across 15 medical centers. We evaluated the impact of cytogenetic risk stratification, age, performance status, and treatment protocols on overall survival and disease-free survival. Results show significant improvements in outcomes with targeted therapies in specific genetic subgroups. Older patients (>65 years) benefit from hypomethylating agents combined with venetoclax. The study provides evidence for personalized treatment approaches based on molecular profiling.",0.208,0.249,0.183,0.899,Oncol√≥gico,0.918,Archivo,Alta,2.2
